## Testing the System

Run the test to see the workflow in action:

python simple_test.py

# Test with CrewAI integration (if dependencies are installed)
cd amanfirstagent/src
python -m amanfirstagent.main truck_booking
```

## Integration Points

### API Endpoints (for real implementation):
1. **Truck Search API**: `GET /api/trucks/search?from={pickup}&to={delivery}`
2. **Booking API**: `POST /api/bookings`
3. **Owner Contact API**: `POST /api/owners/contact`

### Database Tables Needed:
- `trucks` (id, owner_id, type, capacity, location, status)
- `owners` (id, name, contact, rating)
- `bookings` (id, truck_id, user_id, details, status)
- `trip_details` (booking_id, consigner, consignee, addresses, parcel_info)

## Security Features

- Input validation for all user inputs
- Phone number and email masking in logs
- Dangerous pattern detection
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Telegram Bot**: Connect to your existing telegram_bot.py
2. **Real API Connections**: Replace simulated responses with actual API calls
3. **Database Integration**: Store bookings and truck information
4. **Payment Integration**: Add payment processing
5. **Real-time Tracking**: GPS tracking for booked trucks
6. **SMS/Email Notifications**: Send booking confirmations

Your truck booking system is ready to handle the complete user journey from "I need a truck" to "Booking confirmed"! üéâ
